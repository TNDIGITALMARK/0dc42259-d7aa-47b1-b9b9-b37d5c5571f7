## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why is product development the largest expense?
**A**: Technology companies must continuously innovate to stay competitive. Engineering talent is expensive but essential for building features users love. This investment ensures the product improves every month.

### Q: Why spend 22.5% on marketing?
**A**: User acquisition is the lifeblood of subscription businesses. Without consistent growth, churn eventually erodes the user base. Marketing investment must exceed churn to achieve net growth.

### Q: Can you reduce infrastructure costs?
**A**: Infrastructure costs scale with users. At 62,000 users, 17.5% is efficient. As user base grows, this percentage typically decreases due to economies of scale (should drop to 10-12% at 100K+ users).

### Q: Why not just save more money (increase profit margin)?
**A**: Early-stage subscription businesses must prioritize growth over profit. Every dollar saved on growth is a dollar that could have acquired a customer worth $210 lifetime value. Profit margins increase naturally at scale.

### Q: How long until the business is profitable?
**A**: With current growth rates, break-even occurs around 15,000-20,000 Pro users (approximately 6-12 months). After that, profit margins improve rapidly as infrastructure costs become more efficient at scale.

### Q: What happens if users cancel?
**A**: The 4.2% monthly churn rate is built into financial projections. Win-back campaigns, annual discounts, and continuous product improvements keep churn low. A healthy LTV:CAC ratio (11.7:1) provides substantial buffer.
